    <h3>What does an Electrical engineer do?</h3>
    <p>Electrical engineer design, develop and maintain electrical controle system and component to required specifications. Electrical engineers are involved in projects from the concept and detial of the design, through to implementation, testing and handover. They may be involved in maintenance programmes. as well as having technical knowledge, electrical engineer need to be able to project manage and multitask. they also need to have commercial awareness. Additional atributes, such as tesm leadership or management skills, are required as career progress. Electrical engineer can work in very wide rang of sectors, including Transport networks, power genration, tranmition and distrbution, manufacturing, building services, telecommunications as well as scientific and military research.</p>
