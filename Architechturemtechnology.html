    <h3>What does an Architect do?</h3>
    <p>Architects design the house, offices, apartments, commercial, educational, recreational and other such buildings.
        An Architect also caters that the buildings should not only be safe & sound and provide a pleasing aesthetics
        but also be comfortable to the users. An Architect draws up the final plans showing how a building sahll lock
        after its completion and how it shall be built. He also looks into the services to be installed in a building
        along with its security checks, etc. He also capable to draw all these plans with the help of computer software.
        An Architect spend most of the time in office; however, he is supposed to visit the construction site of the
        building he design to see if it is being constructed as per his instruction.</p>
